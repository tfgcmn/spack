TODO:
=====

* fix bazel (SPACK_ environment variables have to kept down to the calls to gcc, ld, etc)
  => needs patching, did manage to fix compile steps but not link steps :/
* tensorflow (req. bazel and py-pyzmq and protobuf somehow?)

Check if really needed:
  * logilab
  * py-mpld3
  * py-numba
  * py-path
  * py-pluggy
  * py-prompt
  * py-pyflakes
  * py-tabulate
  * py-termcolor
  * py-wrapt
  * py-xmlrunner
  * py-pymongo

Lower-level Errors:
===================

* py-pyqt and py-pyside generate a difference in the spec for libxcb
  one version which explicitly depends on python (WTF?)
  and one version which does not => two libxcb => two qt => ...
* py-pygtk => glib in 2nd version due to build fail on older version
